### ü§ó Basic Operations

#### ‚ûï Setting Data

Adding data is a breeze. Just use the `set_data` method. If the key already exists, you'll get a friendly reminder to use `edit_data` instead.

<pre>
# Set data without extra-data
db.set_data("posts")

# Set data with extra-data
db.set_data("users/1", {"name": "Aliou", "age": 20})
db.set_data("users/2", {"name": "Coder", "age": 25})
</pre>

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Editing Data

Need to update data? No problem. Use the `edit_data` method. It merges the new data with the existing data, so nothing gets lost.

<pre>
# Edit data
db.edit_data("users/1", {"name": "Alex"})
</pre>

#### ‚òëÔ∏è Getting Data

Retrieving data is as simple as it gets. Use the `get_data` method.

<pre>
# Get data
print(db.get_data("users/1"))  # Output: {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 20}
print(db.get_data("users/2"))  # Output: {'name': 'Coder', 'age': 25}
</pre>

> [!TIP]
> You can directly access specific data by using paths in the `get_data` method. For example, to get only the user's name, you can do:
<pre>
print(db.get_data("users/1/name"))
</pre>

Here, you get the user's name without retrieving other parts of the data.

#### üóëÔ∏è Removing Data

Need to delete something? The `remove_data` method has you covered.

<pre>
# Remove data
db.remove_data("users/2")
</pre>

#### üì¶ Full Database Retrieval

Want to see everything? Use the `get_db` method. Set `raw=True` if you want the data in a readable format.

<pre>
# Get the full database
print(db.get_db(raw=True))
</pre>

## üîç Search Data (new)

This new feature was integrated in response to the [issue](https://github.com/codingtuto/LiteJsonDb/issues/2) raised about improving data search capabilities. This function allows you to search for values within your database, either across the entire database or within a specific key. This enhancement makes finding your data much easier and more efficient.

### How to use

The `search_data` function provides two main modes of search:

1. **Basic Search**: Search for a value anywhere in the database.
2. **Key-specific Search**: Search for a value within a specific key.

### Integration

1. **Use the `search_data` Function**

   Here‚Äôs how you can use the `search_data` function:

   - **Basic Search**: To search for a value across the entire database, use the following code:

     ```python
     results = db.search_data("Aliou")
     print(results)
     ```

     This will search for the value `"Aliou"` throughout all the keys in your database.

   - **Key-specific Search**: To search for a value within a specific key, use the following code:

     ```python
     results = db.search_data("Aliou", key="users")
     print(results)
     ```

     This will search for the value `"Aliou"` specifically within the `"users"` key.

## üì¶ Backup to Telegram (new)

This feature was integrated to help you easily back up your files, such as your database, directly to a Telegram chat. By using this method, you can safely back up important files automatically to a Telegram conversation.

### How to use

The `backup_to_telegram` function allows you to back up any file to Telegram via a bot. You will need two essential pieces of information: the **bot token** and the **chat ID** where the file will be sent.

### Integration

1. **Obtain your Telegram bot token**  
   To use this feature, you first need to create a bot on Telegram using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Once your bot is created, BotFather will provide you with a token that you will use for authentication.

2. **Find your chat ID**  
   You can get your chat ID by using [@MissRose_bot](https://t.me/MissRose_bot) and typing `/id`. It will give you your unique chat ID.

3. **Use the `backup_to_telegram` Function**  
   Here's how to use the `backup_to_telegram` function:

   <pre><code>python
   db.backup_to_telegram("your_token", "your_chat_id")
   </code></pre>

   This will send the backup file to the specified chat ID using your Telegram bot.

## üì¶ Export to CSV (new)

This feature was integrated to allow you to easily export your data to CSV format. This makes it convenient to share and analyze your data outside the application by creating CSV files that can be opened with spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets.

### How to use

The `export_to_csv` method allows you to export either a specific collection or the entire database. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

### Integration
1. **Prepare your data**  
   Ensure that the data you want to export is well-structured. You can have your data as dictionaries or lists of dictionaries. For example:

   <pre><code>
   # Adding example data
   db.set_data("users", {
       "1": {"name": "Aliou", "age": 20},
       "2": {"name": "Coder", "age": 25}
   })
   </code></pre>

2. **Use the `export_to_csv` Method**  
   Here‚Äôs how to call the method to export data:

   #### Export a Specific Collection

   To export a specific collection, you need to provide the corresponding key:

   <pre><code>
   # Export a specific collection
   db.export_to_csv("users") 
   </code></pre>

   #### Export the Entire Database

   If you want to export all the data from the database, you can call the method without parameters:

   <pre><code>
   # Export the entire database
   db.export_to_csv()  
   </code></pre>

## üêõ Error Handling

This feature is experimental and may not support all data formats. If you attempt to export a collection that does not exist, an error message will be displayed:

If you receive errors like this: `Oops! An error occurred during CSV export: ...` we recommend opening an issue in our repository so we can address it. Your feedback is valuable, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to improve this feature!

### üìÅ Working with Subcollections

## üìÅ Subcollections

In LiteJsonDb, subcollections are a way to organize your data hierarchically. Think of them as nested structures that allow you to group related data together under a parent key. This feature is especially useful when you want to manage complex data relationships without losing the simplicity of JSON.

### ü§î What Are Subcollections?

Subcollections are essentially collections within collections. For example, if you have a main collection of users, you might want to organize their posts into separate subcollections. Here‚Äôs how you can work with them:

- **Setting Subcollection Data**: Create and populate a subcollection under a specified parent key.
- **Editing Subcollection Data**: Update existing items in a subcollection.
- **Getting Subcollection Data**: Retrieve the data stored within a subcollection.
- **Removing Subcollection Data**: Delete items or entire subcollections.

Using subcollections helps you maintain a clear structure in your data, making it easier to manage and query.

#### ‚ûï Setting Subcollection Data

Organize your data with subcollections. Easy peasy.

<pre>
# Set subcollection data
db.set_subcollection("groups", "1", {"name": "Admins"})
</pre>

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Editing Subcollection Data

Editing items within a subcollection? No sweat.

<pre>
# Edit subcollection data
db.edit_subcollection("groups", "1", {"description": "Admin group"})
</pre>

#### ‚òëÔ∏è Getting Subcollection Data

Need to retrieve specific subcollections or items? We've got you.

<pre>
# Get subcollection data
print(db.get_subcollection("groups"))

# Get custom item from the subcollection data
print(db.get_subcollection("groups", "1"))
</pre>

#### üóëÔ∏è Removing Subcollection Data

Removing items from subcollections is just as simple.

<pre>
# Remove subcollection data
db.remove_subcollection("groups", "1")
</pre>

## üêõ Error Handling

LiteJsonDb is all about being helpful. Here are some friendly, colorful error messages to guide you:

- **Key Exists**: If you try to set data with an existing key, it will suggest using `edit_data`.
- **Key Not Found**: If a key does not exist when you try to get or remove data, it will notify you with a tip on how to proceed.
- **File Issues**: If there are file permission problems, it will guide you on how to fix them.

## üìÇ Example Project Structure

Here's how your project might look if your initialized `LiteJssonDb`:

<pre>
project/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db_backup.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LiteJsonDb.log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_code.py
</pre>

## üöÄ Example `main.py`

Let's put it all together with an example `main.py` file:

<pre>
import LiteJsonDb
  
# Initialize the database with encryption enabled
db =  LiteJsonDb.JsonDB()

# Add some initial data
# Set data without extra-data
db.set_data("posts")

# Set data with extra-data
db.set_data("users/1", {"name": "Aliou", "age": 20})
db.set_data("users/2", {"name": "Coder", "age": 25})

# Modify existing data
db.edit_data("users/1", {"name": "Alex"})

# Retrieve and print data
print(db.get_data("users/1"))
print(db.get_data("users/2"))

# Remove data
db.remove_data("users/2")

# Perform a basic search
results = db.search_data("Aliou")
print("Basic Search Results:", results)

# Perform a key-specific search
results = db.search_data("Aliou", key="users")
print("Key-specific Search Results:", results)

# Retrieve the full database
print(db.get_db(raw=True))

# Work with subcollections
db.set_subcollection("groups", "1", {"name": "Admins"})
db.edit_subcollection("groups", "1", {"description": "Admin group"})
print(db.get_subcollection("groups"))
db.remove_subcollection("groups", "1")

# IF YOU WANT TO BACKUP THE DATABASE ON TELEGRAM
# db.backup_to_telegram("your_token", "your_chat_id")

""" IF YOU WANT TO EXPORT YOUR DATA ON CSV FORMAT
# Export a specific collection
db.export_to_csv("users") 

# Export the entire database
db.export_to_csv()
"""
</pre>

## üìù Understanding `set_data` vs. Subcollections

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### `set_data`

The `set_data` method is used to add or update data at a specific path. If the key already exists, you will need to use `edit_data` to modify it. This method is great for simple key-value pairs or straightforward data structures.

<pre>
# Set data
db.set_data("users/1", {"name": "Aliou", "age": 20})
</pre>

### Subcollections

Subcollections, on the other hand, are used to create and manage nested structures within your database. They allow you to group related data under a parent key, providing a more organized way to handle complex relationships. Subcollections are essentially collections within collections.

<pre>
# Set subcollection data
db.set_subcollection("groups", "1", {"name": "Admins"})
</pre>

### Key Differences

- **Structure**: `set_data` is used for flat data structures, while subcollections allow for hierarchical organization.
- **Usage**: Use `set_data` for simple key-value pairs and `set_subcollection` when you need nested collections.
- **Organization**: Subcollections help in maintaining a clear structure and grouping related data together, making it easier to manage and query complex relationships.

By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate method for your data management needs, ensuring a well-organized and efficient database.
